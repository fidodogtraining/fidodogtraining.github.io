  <h3>Terms &amp; conditions</h3>
  <p>To ensure the health and safety of your dog and all other guests, we require
    that all of our clients agree and comply with the following terms and conditions:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>I specifically represent to Fido Personal Dog Training, LLC that I am the
      legal owner of my dog. In addition, my dog is healthy; my dog meets Fido Personal
      Dog Trainings vaccination standards and has not been exposed to any known
      communicable disease within the 30-day period immediately prior to admission
      to the Puppy Program. I further represent that each time my dog is brought
      to Fido Personal Dog Training I will be recertifying that my dog is in good
      health and has not had any communicable illness of any kind for 30 days prior
      to admission. I further agree to inform Fid Personal Dog Training of any changes
      in my dog’s condition and/or behavior prior to any Puppy Program visit.</li>
    <li>Puppy age requirements for the Puppy PAL Program are 2 ½ months to 6 months
      old.  The Puppy Program is offered Mondays and Fridays only, from
      7:00 A.M. – 11:00 A.M. then again at 1:00 P.M. – 4:00 P.M. Puppy pick up times
      are: 11:00 A.M – 12:00 P.M and 4:00 P.M - 5:00 P.M. A reservation must be

    <li>Puppies not picked up by closing time (12:00 or 5:00 P.M.) will be charged
      $10.00 for every 15 minutes after pick up times.</li>
    <li>I understand that my Puppy is required to be vaccinated (including distemper,
      parvo, and bordetella) and I will provide Fido Personal Dog Training with
      proof from my veterinarian. I agree to provide Fido Personal Dog Training
      with annual updates of my dog’s vaccination records. I acknowledge that it
      is my responsibility to ensure that my dog continues to be fully vaccinated
      and that Fido Personal Dog Training reserves the right to remove my dog from
      the facility if it is not fully vaccinated.</li>
    <li>I understand that my dog must have flea protection in the form of a topical
      liquid such as K9 Advantix, Advantage or Frontline. I acknowledge that flea
      collars are not acceptable. I understand that my dog will be inspected for
      fleas when entering Fido Personal Dog Training, and will be refused entrance
      if fleas are found. I further acknowledge that Fido Personal Dog Training
      shall not be held responsible if my dog contracts fleas while at Fido Personal
      Dog Training because proper flea protection is my responsibility.</li>
    <li>Fido Personal Dog Training will do everything in our power to keep and
      maintain a safe and fun environment for your puppy.  Please understand that
      the leash-free Puppy Program at Fido Personal Dog Training provides puppies
      the opportunity to play in close physical contact, including with their teeth and paws.</li>
    <li>I acknowledge that no amount of supervision or personalized care by Fido
      Personal Dog Training, its agents or employees, can prevent the possibility
      of injury or illness to my dog.</li>
    <li>I accept the risks involved in Puppy Play. I agree to indemnify and hold
      harmless Fido Personal Dog Training from any and all claims, liabilities,
      costs and expenses, including court costs and attorney fees, arising out of
      any harm or injury caused by my Puppy to other Puppy or persons. I authorize
      Fido Personal Dog Training to do whatever is deemed necessary for the safety,
      health and well-being of my dog and I agree to assume full financial responsibility
      for any and all medical expenses incurred. I expressively wave and relinquish
      any and all claims against Fido Personal Dog Training, its employees, agents,
      and representatives for any injury, illness, or harm to my Puppy. Under no
      circumstances will Fido Personal Dog Training be liable for consequential
      damages or damages beyond the replacement value of my dog.</li>
    <li>I understand Fido Personal Dog Training reserves the right to refuse admittance
      to any Puppy that displays signs of untreated or potentially contagious conditions,
      demonstrates aggressive behavior, or who fails our standard health and temperament
      policies. I further understand and agree that any problems that develop with
      my dog will be treated as deemed appropriate by the staff of Fido Personal
      Dog Training, in their sole discretion</li>
    <li>In the event any provision of this agreement is declared by a court of
      competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall
      remain in full force and effect.</li>
  </ol>

    the pet’s behavior during and after the Puppy Program.</p>

  <h3>CANCELLATIONS</h3>
  <p>The Owner of the pet(s) may postpone any of the PAL Program by providing twenty-four
    hours notice to FIDO. FIDO twenty-four hours notice of a PAL Program cancellation
