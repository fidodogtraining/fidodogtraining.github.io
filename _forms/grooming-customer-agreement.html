  <h3>PET(S) AND GROOMER SAFETY</h3>
  <p>Every client is required to read and sign this Policy Agreement prior to
    any grooming services being performed.</p>
  <p>I, the undersigned customer, do hereby entrust my pet(s) to Fido’s Gray Dog
    Grooming for the purpose of grooming my pet(s).</p>
  <p>We require a current copy of your pet(s)s’ vaccination records. Rabies
    vaccination is required, as are DHLP-Parvo & Bordetella (Kennel Cough). This
    is for the safety of both your dog(s) and other dogs in the building. If no
    proof is provided, we will have to confirm vaccination with your Veterinarian
    BEFORE you leave your pet(s) at our facility.</p>
  <p>Due care will be taken with the pet(s) for the safety of the pet(s) and groomer.
    I am aware that if my pet(s) does not respond to the groomer and remain still
    during the grooming procedure accidents can happen such as nicks from clippers
    or scissors or toenail trimmers. Dogs that are unable to be safely groomed will
    be return with services provided to the extent that the dog will allow. Severely
    matted dogs will not be dematted, for the safety and comfort of the dog. Dogs
    with extensive matting or matting in sensitive areas will be shaved to a
    comfortable length.</p>
  <p>For the pet(s) to properly respond to the groom it is essential that the pet(s)
    be alone with the groomer and clients will not assist in the grooming unless
    requested to do so.</p>
  <p>Customer assumes all liabilities, financial and otherwise, for the behavior
    and health of their pet(s). In consideration of the services rendered by Fido’s
    Gray Dog Grooming, Customer waives any and all claims, actions, or demands of
    any nature, foreseen or unforeseen, against Gray Dog Grooming relating to the
    care, control, health, and/or safety of Customer's pet(s) arising during services
    performed by the salon.</p>

  <h3>PET(S) HEALTH CONDITIONS</h3>
  <p>Allergies and Sensitivities: Your dog's safety and comfort is our primary
    concern. Please advise us of any allergies, sensitivities, or pre-existing
    medical conditions so we can avoid aggravating these situations. Please let
    us know of any prior grooming history you or your dog may not have found
    satisfactory. We want to avoid the repetition of poor or unpleasant
    experiences or situations.</p>
  <p>Fido’s Gray Dog Grooming understands that some dogs are extremely sensitive
    to certain grooming procedures such as nail trimming and/or ear cleaning. It
    is not our intent to cause your dog discomfort, so although these are routine
    procedures normally performed for the well-being of the pet(s), we will not
    continue with any grooming procedure that will cause pain, discomfort, or fear
    to the pet(s) or harm to the groomer. Sometimes these procedures are best
    left to the care of a veterinarian.</p>
  <p>The groomer will be held harmless from damage, loss or claims arising from
    any known or unknown pre-existing condition of the pet(s). The terms special
    services or handling shall include but are not limited to veterinary emergency
    services in the event that the client is not available. Client authorizes the
    groomer to act as his/her agent in the event emergency veterinarian services,
    boarding, care-taking, and/or transportation is necessary and agrees to pay
    all costs. Any/all damages or claims shall include but not be limited to
    advanced age, extreme nervousness, neurosis, illness, previous injury, skin
    or coat conditions or other medical conditions.</p>

  <h3>FLEA INFESTATION/SALON SANITATION</h3>
  <p>If fleas are found on your pet, Gray Dog’s will administer a flea bath to
    eradicate the fleas in order to maintain salon sanitation. This is at the
    groomer’s discretion and at the client’s expense. The shampoo is gentle,
    non-alkaline and hypoallergenic.</p>

  <h3>MATTED OR NEGLECTED COAT AND SHAVE DOWNS OR CUSTOM CUTS</h3>
  <p>Allowing a pet’s coat to get matted is not only very UNCOMFORTABLE, but
    DANGEROUS for your pet’s health. Excessive matting can be avoided with regular
    brushing and grooming and the groomer will be happy to show you some brushing
    techniques for mat prevention.</p>
  <p>The groomer will de-mat the pet (if possible) at $1 per minute (minimum $15)
    in addition to the regular grooming fee OR the pet will receive a “shave down”
    to remove the mats. Under this circumstance, a shave down is the only way to
    allow the skin to receive necessary oxygen and for new, healthy hair to grow.
    Charges for the shave down or shaving ears and tail if they are matted are
    determined on a per pet basis. If the client requests the mats be combed out,
    the groomer will not do so if it causes pet undue stress or pain. Excessive
    de-matting is a painful, time-consuming and costly procedure that causes
    extreme discomfort and can aggravate (or cause) skin problems.</p>
  <p>Neglect of your pet's coat can be cause for problems after grooming such as
    clipper/brush irritation.</p>
  <p>Shave downs or custom cuts that are outside normal specific breed haircuts
    will be discussed and the groomer will perform the cuts to the best of her
    understanding of client’s directions and her ability but no other guarantee
    is made.</p>
  <p>Shaving of your pet may dramatically change your pet’s appearance and the
    hair will be very close to the skin. This may expose pre-existing skin
    conditions. Shaving severely matted ears may cause your dog to shake his or
    her head due to the new, lighter sensation and hematomas can develop.</p>

  <h3>PAYMENT</h3>
  <p>I understand that payment for grooming services is due at the time the
    services are rendered unless prior arrangements have been made. I understand
    there is a $30 non sufficient funds/returned check charge and I will be
    placed on a cash only basis thereafter.</p>

  <h3>CANCELLATIONS</h3>
  <p>A courtesy reminder email or text will be sent up to 72 hours prior to your
    appointment time. An email address is required.</p>
  <p>Fido’s Gray Dog Grooming must be notified at least 24 hours prior to the
  scheduled appointment of any cancellations. Leaving a message on the business
  answering machine is sufficient. This allows us time to try to book a replacement
  for your vacated appointment. The client may be billed for the normal grooming
  charge if 24 hour cancellation notice is not provided.</p>
  <p>Service may be terminated for repeated cancellations without 24 hr. notice.</p>

  <h3>LATE or "NO SHOWS"</h3>
  <p>If unforeseen circumstances cause us to be late, we will call and make
    arrangements for a later discharge. Please be sure to provide us with a cell
    phone or home number where you can be reached in case we are late. If you opt
    out of our bring home service, dogs are expected to be picked up within an
    hour of your being notified that the groom is completed. This is to lower
    stress levels in both your dog and the other dogs on site. Dogs not picked up
    within an hour will be charged at the rate of $10 per hour in addition to
    the cost of the groom.</p>
  <p>Customer releases Fido’s  Gray Dog Grooming, its agents, officers,
    sub-contractors, and employees from any and all liabilities, financial, and
    otherwise, for injuries to Customer, Customer's pet(s), or any other property
    of Customer, which arise in any way from services and/or products provided by
    or as a consequence of Customer's association with Fido’s Gray Dog Grooming
    including, but not limited to, veterinarian bills.</p>
  <p>I, the undersigned, have read and understand and agree to the above terms
    and my rights and obligations for the grooming and maintenance of my pet(s)
    and in consideration of the grooming services of Fido’s Gray Dog Grooming</p>
