So you just got a puppy — congrats! Our Puppy 1 class will give you and your new 
four-legged family member the skills needed to grow into a well-rounded, happy adult 
dog! 

We’ll teach you the basics of clicker training and help you tackle and understand 
common puppy problem behaviors like house breaking, chewing and mouthing, jumping 
up and more. Basic cues like, sit, down, stand and the beginnings of loose leash 
walking will be covered, along with some fun tricks and self-control exercises! 

Just as importantly, your puppy will learn about and experience other dogs, people 
and new environments — all important to your pup’s social development! Each class 
includes several short, carefully-controlled play sessions to help your puppy learn 
the acceptable rules of social interaction with other dogs. 

This class is for pups between the ages of 2 1/2 to 4 months old. Puppies between 
5-6 months old are welcome to join our Puppy 2 class but are not eligible for Puppy 
1. Puppies must have two rounds of vaccinations before attending class. 

_Please, come join the fun! Your puppy will love you for it_
