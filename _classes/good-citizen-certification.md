An American Kennel Club endorsed title that promotes responsible dog ownership 
and good doggy manners.

The AKC CGC program provides an excellent foundation for training in other fun 
activities such as rally, obedience, and agility. Therapy-dog groups often have passing the CGC 
test as a prerequisite for entrance into site-specific programs, some insurance companies recommend CGC training, and 
an increasing number of apartments and condos are asking for CGC training for 
resident dogs. 

Open to all dogs, regardless of breed! This is a 3-week prep class with 
testing for the certificate on the 4th week.

_Our goal is to promote responsible and healthy dog ownership_
