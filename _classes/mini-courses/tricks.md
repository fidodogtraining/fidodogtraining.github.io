Teaching your dog tricks is a great way to sharpen your training skills, build a bond with your dog and provide him with mental enrichment. Plus it’s fun! But tricks can also help your dog become more comfortable with handling at the vet and groomer, help him be calm and make him more confident! In this 4-week class we will learn three tricks that are both fun and practical:

“Play dead” (teaches your dog to lie on his side)
“Shake/Hi-Five” (teaches your dog having his feet handled is a good thing)
“Rest Your Head” (teaches your dog calm behavior pays off)

This is a great class for dogs who need to be handled frequently at the groomer or vet or for any dog that needs to use his brain more often!
