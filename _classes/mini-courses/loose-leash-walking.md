Teaching your dog to walk with a loose leash can be a very frustrating job for 
both you and your dog. We will show you Positive Reinforcement Training 
techniques which communicate to your dog that it is more rewarding and fun to 
walk next to you than to pull ahead.

These classes are designed to help you work on teaching your dog to walk with 
a loose leash at your side.
