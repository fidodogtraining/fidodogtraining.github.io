Designed for blossoming dog trainers age 14-17, this class promotes safe and force-free handling, encourages teens to interact with their dogs in a positive manner, and promotes a sense of responsibility for the dog's care. We will cover obediencebasics, learn a fun trick, talk about body language (a wagging tail doesn't always mean a happy dog!), and discuss general dog care. 

Guardian must be present, but the teens will be handling and training the dogs.
