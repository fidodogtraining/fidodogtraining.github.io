Designed for the young handler, this class promotes safe and force-free handling, encourages teens to interact with 
their dogs in a positive manner, and promotes a sense of responsibility for the dog's care. We will cover obedience
basics, learn a fun trick, talk about body language (a wagging tail doesn't always mean a happy dog!), and discuss 
general dog care. 

Guardian's presence is required if the handler cannot physically control the dog, otherwise parents are welcome to 
attend but participation is optional.
