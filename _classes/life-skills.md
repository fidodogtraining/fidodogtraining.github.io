If your dog loves to play with other dogs but needs to work on “real life” skills, this class is for you! 
We will work on skills and cues like “turn and go” with distraction, recall from play, stay with distraction, 
leash walking and dog introductions! These are especially important things to help your playful adolescent 
grow into a social and well-mannered adult! This class is open to dogs ages 6 to 18 months who have aged out
of PAL or are graduates of Puppy 1 and 2.
