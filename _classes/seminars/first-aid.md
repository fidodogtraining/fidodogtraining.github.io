Learn First Aid basics, find out what should be in your canine emergency kit, and get the answers to common health questions! Felicia Asher, KPA Certified Dog Trainer and Licensed Veterinary Technician, will be teaching this 
wonderful class for us. A live dog will be on site so that you get hands on practice finding a pulse, but please 
leave your own pooch at home; this is a person-only class. 

This is valuable information for anyone who lives with a dog! Please call to sign up, space is limited to 20 
students. Each student will take home a First Aid book and Felicia's own handouts.
