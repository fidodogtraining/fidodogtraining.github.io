## In-home pet sitting

Standard sitting hours are from 7:00 PM until 10:00 AM. A mid-day courtesy 
let-out is included with each subsequent overnight so that your pooch 
isn't left alone for too long without a potty break. If you need a visit
before 7:00 PM on the date your overnights begin or after 10:00 AM on the
morning they end, additional walks or let outs can be arranged with 
your sitter. Hours may vary according to sitter's schedule. 
Variances will be agreed upon before visit. 

Sitting starts at **$65 per night**. Dog Walking and Pet Sitting on Holidays is an 
additional $10 per day (New Year's Day, Easter, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day) 
Additional fees apply for clients outside of service area, please call for a price.
