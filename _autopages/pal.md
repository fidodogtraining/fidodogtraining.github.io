## FIDO’s Play and Learn (PAL) program

<a class="button" href="https://squareup.com/store/FidoPersonalDogTraining/item/puppy-pal-program">Register today</a>

Take your puppy's training beyond classes with our Play and Learn (PAL) program! The more we socialize, train and condition 
puppies during puppyhood, the better off they will be as adults. 

Your puppy will spend his PAL time supervised by our trainers who will work on basic manners and conditioning and reward good 
behavior during group play! 

At PAL, your puppy will engage in group play as well as work with our trainers on:

* Basic cues like sit, down and recall
* Confidence gaining and socialization skills
* Handling and conditioning 
* Potty training
* Impulse control
* Appropriate play

PAL runs Mondays and Fridays in two sessions, with the option to sign up for a full day. 
Morning session is 7:00-11:00 AM 
Afternoon session is 1:00-4:00 PM 
PAL is for puppies 2 ½ to 6 months old. All participants must be current on vaccinations, including a clean fecal exam within 30 days of enrollment. 

Sign up for PAL ends at 5pm the evening before the scheduled session to allow us to plan accurately for the puppies. Session 
space is limited so sign up today!
