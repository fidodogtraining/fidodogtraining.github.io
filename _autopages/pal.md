## FIDO’s new Play and Learn (PAL) program

Want to take your puppy’s education further? Our NEW Play and Learn (PAL) program 
is the answer! Our trainers Jean Carew and Christy Hopkins, along with assistant 
Chloe Collins, will keep your puppy’s mind growing! 

At PAL, your puppy will: 

  * Practice Recall
  * Gain socialization skills
  * Refine potty training
  * Build confidence and impulse control
  * Play crate games
  * Experience enrichment and training in a structured environment

PAL is for puppies 2 ½ to 6 months old and space is limited today so sign up today! 
This program is held at Fido on Mondays and Fridays in two sessions, with the option 
to sign up for a full day. Morning session is 7:00-11:00 AM, our afternoon group runs 
from 1:00-4:00 PM. All puppies must be current on vaccinations, including a clean 
fecal exam within 30 days of enrollment.
