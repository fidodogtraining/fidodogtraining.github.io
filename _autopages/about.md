dogs in a manner that the dog can understand. We strive to educate the public about 
positive reinforcement training to promote the betterment and wellbeing of both 
dogs and their people. Life is easier with a well-trained dog! 

Our clients enjoy small classes in our convenient Ferndale office and our carefully 
curated retail section offers the best of the best in toys, treats, and other products 
to assist in your training. In-home training, dog walking, and pet sitting with

Fido also offers comfortable grooming, done by an experienced dog trainer who will 
respect your dog's stress levels and coach them through the process. Our new salon 
has a host of features to make a visit to the groomer an enjoyable day instead of 
something to dread.

needs. Please get in touch today!

## Tammy Crenshaw

### Owner, Head Trainer

<img class="right" src="{{ '/images/tammy.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" />

I have lived with and loved dogs my whole life and have worked with them for 19 
years. I started a pet sitting/dog walking business in 1997 and have been training 
since 2005. I live in Oak Park with my husband Robert, our fast-growing pup Cleo, 
and a silly kitty named Purrscilla. 

One of my primary personal and professional goals is to help dogs live happy lives 
with their human guardians. By teaching people how to communicate with their pets 
in a way that both human and dog can truly understand, I hope to do my part in making 
the dog and human worlds a better place. In my training, I use only science based, 
force free methods. My first-hand experience has shown me that this is the most 
rewarding, compassionate and effective way to train a dog.

I graduated from Animal Behavioral College with honors in 2006. I continued my studies 
by earning my certification through the Certification Council for Professional Dog 
Trainers as a Certified Professional Dog Trainer – Knowledge Assessed (CPDT-KA) 
in 2011.

I love working with dogs and their people, helping to make their lives happy ones 
without force or confusion.

## Sarah Maki

### Head Trainer, Groomer, Office Manager

<img class="right" src="{{ '/images/sarah.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" />

In July of 2008 I adopted my best buddy, a then-4-year-old Tibetan Terrier. Sprocket 
was close to perfect from the start; cute, cuddly, enthusiastic about giving kisses 
and taking walks. He did have one small problem, though: he was a cat chaser!

Calling on the services of a professional, I had Tammy out to the house to see if 
my animals could live in harmony.

From the first 'click' of the clicker, Sprocket and I were hooked on Positive Reinforcement 
Training. Seeing his eyes light up as he realized that he could make good things 
happen by obeying cues was amazing. I couldn't get enough of that reaction, and 
in 2009 I graduated with honors from Animal Behavior College, and my passion became 
my career.

I love getting people to that "lightbulb" moment with their dogs: where dog and 
person learn to communicate with each other, maybe for the first time ever. Training 
our dogs is so satisfying; it deepens our bond and really helps us to know our pup. 
__And it's fun!__ Positive Reinforcement training motivates our dogs to work with 
us, so that training feels like play instead of work.

After adopting my third dog (a silly little muppet mix named Tchotchke), I realized 
there was another thing I could do to help further the Positive Reinforcement message; 
learn to groom in a way that respects the dog's boundaries. Trips to the groomer 
were always stressful. Sprocket and Tchotchke would have to be dragged into the 
tub and came home exhausted and clearly unhappy. I didn't like putting them through 
it, but their coats needed professional care. Even my English Lab, Molly, hated 
going for baths, and she was a pretty easy-going gal. I became determined to find 
another way, and attended Bingo Institute of Grooming to learn how to bathe, clip 
and scissor. 

Fido's Gray Dog Grooming opened its doors in December 2016 and I couldn't be prouder. 
My years of experience in canine body language let me recognize when a dog needs 
coaching, a different method, or just a break. The team at Fido gave their input 
and we designed a salon that minimizes stress and truly is something special. We 
hope you'll check us out and know you'll see the difference between "assembly line" 
groomers and what we're doing here.
