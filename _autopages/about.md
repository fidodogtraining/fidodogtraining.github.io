## Tammy Crenshaw
### Owner, Head Trainer
<img class="right" src="/images/tammy.jpg" alt="" />

I have lived with and loved dogs my whole life and have worked with them for 17 years. 
I started a pet sitting/dog walking business in 1997 and have been training since 2005. 
I live in Oak Park, Michigan with my husband Robert, our pit bull mix Daisy, the action-packed 
cat Posey, and a 30 year old Amazon Parrot named Petey.

One of my primary personal and professional goals is to help dogs live happy lives with their 
human guardians. By teaching people how to communicate with their pets in a way that both 
human and dog can truly understand, I hope to do my part in making dog and human worlds a 
better place.

In my training, I use only science based, force free methods. My first-hand experience has 
shown me that this is the most rewarding, compassionate, and effective way to train a dog. 
I believe positive reinforcement methods are much less stressful on dogs than 
punishment based methods. In fact, most dogs look forward to and even enjoy clicker 
training sessions!

I graduated from Animal Behavioral College with honors in 2006. I continued my studies 
by earning my certification through the Certification Council for Professional Dog Trainers 
as a Certified Professional Dog Trainer – Knowledge Assessed (CPDT-KA) in 2011. I offer 
private and group classes through my company Fido Personal Dog Training, LLC in Ferndale, Michigan.

## Sarah Maki
### Head Trainer, Head Dog Walker
<img class="right" src="/images/sarah.jpg" alt="" />
In July of 2008 I adopted my best buddy, a then-4-year-old Tibetan Terrier. Sprocket was close to perfect 
from the start; cute, cuddly, enthusiastic about giving kisses and taking walks. He did have one small 
problem, though: he was a cat chaser!

With three felines in the house, dog-chases-cat was more than a minor issue. Calling on the services of 
a professional, I had Tammy out to the house to see if my animals could live in harmony.

From the first 'click' of Tammy's clicker, Sprocket and I were hooked on Positive Reinforcement training. 
Seeing his eyes light up as he realized that he could make good things happen by obeying cues was amazing. 
Turning the clicker over to me, Tammy showed me how to teach Sprocket some basic cues. Watching me work 
with him, she remarked that I had good instincts and that I should consider becoming a dog trainer!

I took her words to heart. I've always been an animal lover, and making a career out of working with dogs 
sounded right up my alley! Now I'm an Animal Behavior College Certified Dog Trainer, and I know I've found 
my passion.

I love getting people to that "lightbulb" moment with their dogs: where dog and person learn to communicate 
with each other, maybe for the first time ever. Training our dogs is so satisfying; it deepens our bond and 
really helps us to know our pup. __And it's fun!__ Positive Reinforcement training motivates our dogs to work 
with us, so that training feels like play instead of work.

Sprocket has two sisters now: an English Lab named Molly Moo Cow, and an odd little poodle/muppet mix 
named Tchotchke. The three of them keep me on my toes and provide plenty of opportunity to train every day.
