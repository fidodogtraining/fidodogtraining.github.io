## Private lessons at our office

Dog behaving badly? Need more personal attention than a group class allows? Schedule 
a one-on-one lesson at our office to address any behavioral or obedience problem you 
are having.

This option is perfect for dogs who cannot attend a group class for any 
reason. Our office allows a safe space for your dog to work through his struggles 
and learn new, better manners. 

Cost: In office lessons start at $115 per session. A $75 deposit is required to hold your appointment. Please call for 
details.

## Private lessons in your home

We will come to you! Private, in-home training is customized to solve any issue 
you need help with. Hour long sessions focus on exactly what's troubling your dog 
without the distraction of other class members and since they take place in your home, 
we can address the problem in the environment it is happening in.

Dogs who aren't eligible for a group class, are nervous in new places, or are troubled 
travelers benefit from having us conduct an in-home appointment. 

Cost: In home training starts at $120 per hour. A $75 non-refundable deposit is required to hold your appointment time.
