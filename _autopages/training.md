In addition to [classes](/classes), we offer multiple training options to suit your needs.

## Day Training

We start your dog's training for you! During our weekly sessions we teach cues and 
behaviors and then practice them in your home, our office, and other locations such 
as the park and your neighborhood. It helps your dog get professional training in 
weeks instead of months!

Busy clients appreciate their dog learning the basics or having problem behaviors 
addressed without needing to be present (although you are welcome to attend sessions!). 
We will meet with you several times throughout the program to show you the progress 
your dog is making and answer any questions you have. Support is always available by 
phone or email.

This is a great option for new puppy parents who need help socializing as well as 
adult dogs who have developed bad habits.

Cost: Day training starts at $1650 for a 6 week program.

## Private lessons at our office

Dog behaving badly? Need more personal attention than a group class allows? Schedule 
a one-on-one lesson at our office to address any behavioral or obedience problem you 
are having.

This option is perfect for dogs who cannot attend a group class for any 
reason. Our office allows a safe space for your dog to work through his struggles 
and learn new, better manners. 

Cost: In office lessons start at $115 per session. Please call for details.

## Private lessons in your home

We will come to you! Private, in-home training is customized to solve any issue 
you need help with. Hour long sessions focus on exactly what's troubling your dog 
without the distraction of other class members and since they take place in your home, 
we can address the problem in the environment it is happening in.

Dogs who aren't eligible for a group class, are nervous in new places, or are troubled 
travelers benefit from having us conduct an in-home appointment. 

Cost: In home training starts at $120 per hour. A $50 non-refundable deposit is required to hold your appointment time.
